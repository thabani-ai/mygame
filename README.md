The Football Quiz app is a native Android application developed using Kotlin in Android Studio. It serves as an interactive tool to test users' knowledge of football-related facts through a series of true or false questions. The app features a clean, user-friendly interface with a welcome screen and a quiz activity. Users begin by tapping a "Start" button, which navigates to the quiz screen.
Each question is displayed with True and False buttons, allowing the user to respond. Feedback is instantly provided, indicating whether the answer was correct or incorrect. The "Next Question" button becomes enabled only after an answer is selected, improving user flow and preventing accidental skipping.
The app maintains a score as the user progresses through the questions. At the end of the quiz, a summary is displayed showing the total score and a motivational message. Key design choices include proper state management of UI components and the use of constraint and linear layouts for responsive design.
Basic error prevention is implemented, such as disabling answer buttons after use. The app supports easy updates by simply adding more questions and answers to the arrays. It also follows modular coding practices, separating logic and UI handling for maintainability. Overall, the app provides an engaging quiz experience
